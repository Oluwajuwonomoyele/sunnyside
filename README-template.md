## Overview
The Sunny side agency landing page is a project i worked on with html, pure css and vanilla javascript, vanilla javascript for the navigation bar mobile view toggle functionality.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site on a large screen and a 500px width responsive mobile view
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process
I started out with the desktop-first workflow then went on to design the mobile workflow. It took me 3 days to complete this project and I learnt a few things on the cause of buliding this project. I commited to github per every section I made so as to have a clear understanding when reverting back to commits. I also contemplated on either using pure css or bootstrap, then i decided to use pure css after much delibration. I was really fun working on this project!

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Destop-first workflow

### Continued development

For future reference, i'll like to focus on the navigation bar styling mostly on mobile view and also javascript functionality of pages.
